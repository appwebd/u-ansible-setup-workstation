## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We welcome reports of any security vulnerabilities or incidents that affect
this repository. Your help makes the project safer for everyone.

### How to Report

1. **Create a new issue**  
   - Go to the **Issues** tab of this repository.  
   - Choose **New issue** and select the **Security Vulnerability** template
     (if available).  
   - If the template is not present, simply add a title that starts with
     `Security:`.

2. **Provide detailed information**  
   - **Description** – Explain the issue and how it can be reproduced.  
   - **Impact** – Outline the potential consequences for users or the system.  
   - **Suggested fix** – If you have a patch or a workaround, include it.  
   - **Screenshots / logs** – Attach any relevant evidence.

3. **Do not publish the details publicly**  
   - Until the issue is resolved, keep the description and any
     code snippets confidential.  
   - If you need to share the vulnerability with external parties
     (e.g., security vendors), do so via a private channel or
     encrypted email.

4. **Contact information**  
   - For direct communication, email:  
     **security@appwebd.com**  
     (Please do not send sensitive details over public channels.)

5. **Timeline**  
   - We aim to acknowledge a new vulnerability report within **48 hours**.  
   - Patches will be provided and merged as soon as they are
     validated.  

6. **Acknowledgment**  
   - Once a fix is deployed, the reporter will receive a public
     acknowledgment (unless they opt out).  
   - If you prefer anonymity, let us know and we’ll respect your choice.

### Security Incident Handling

- If you suspect a security incident (e.g., data breach, unauthorized
  access), contact **security@appwebd.com** immediately.  
- Use the same email and follow the same reporting steps, but prefix the
  subject with `Incident:`.

### Responsible Disclosure

- We strongly encourage **responsible disclosure**: report
  privately first, give us time to respond, and only publish details
  after a fix is released or an official policy has been followed.

Thank you for helping keep this project secure.
